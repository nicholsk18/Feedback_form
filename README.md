# Feedback form
I created this as part of a larger project I am working where I will use this form to get feedback on my work from freelance clients. This was also designed to practice using flexbox.

## Upcoming Features
- Will implement a backend that will send an email to let me know when feedback was left
- Store feedback in a database
- Create endpoint to connect feedback to my portfolio. (Display reviews on my page)
- Change the the design and layout a bit as this project started as a FreeCodeCamp project
- Convert the app to use React?
